# Git Branching Exercise

This repository contains a simple exercise to practice Git branching and merging.

## Forking this Repository

To get started, you need to fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub page of this repository.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.
4. Wait for GitHub to create the forked repository in your account.
5. Once the fork is complete, you will be redirected to your forked repository.
6. Copy the URL of your forked repository from the address bar of your browser.
7. Open a terminal on your local machine.
8. Change to the directory where you want to clone the repository (e.g. `cd ~/Desktop`).
9. Clone the forked repository to your local machine by running the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/software-dev-course-git-branching.git
   ```

## Running the Application

This repository contains a simple Node.js application. To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application by running:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Once you have run the application, you should see a message in the terminal saying "Hello, World!", 
and the numbers 0 to 9 printed on separate lines.  If you want to understand the application, you 
can review the code in `src/index.js`.  It is not a very complicated application, and it is not
very important to understand it fully for the purposes of this exercise.
